							<h2>Backstory and Roadmap</h2>
							<p>Below is my initial thought but it is now all scraped as my friend reminded me it sounds Ponzi LMAO <br /> </p>
							<p>	So I thought f**k it, why not let the community to decide? <br /> </p>
							<p>	A roadmap by community? A true Web 3.0 DAO project? Probably.</p>

								<h3>Royalties Explained</h3>
								<p>This exploration could not be completed without the born of all Galaxians. That's why minters get <i></i><strong>Instant 25% Cash Royalties From Next Sales</strong></i>, executed by our <em>Low Gas Smart Contract</em> to save gas fees.
								Imagine you are the 1st Minter who minted the 1st <sup>NFT</sup> with 0.001 $ETH. You will instantly get 0.0005 $ETH (50% Rebated!) when the 2nd <sup>NFT</sup> is minted with 0.002 $ETH.
								Our Smart Contract only allows 1 mint per transaction. This allows rewards for Galaxian Pioneers with multiple mints get all the Royalties upon each mint.
								To understand that mechanism in details, visit the code here: <code>uint amount = msg.value * 25 / 100; _mintLoop(msg.sender, _mintAmount); payable(previousOwnerAddress).transfer(amount);previousOwnerAddress = msg.sender;</code>, deployed in Ethereum as ERC721.</p>
								<p><section class="image fit"><div class="image"><img src="images/royalties.png" alt="" /></div></p></section>
								<hr />
									<h3>"Price Inflation" Strategy</h3>
									<p>The Mint Price would be <strong>increased 0.001 $ETH per mint</strong>.</p>
									
									<p>The Total Sales Revenue = 0.001 + 0.002 + 0.003 + ... + 3.844 $ETH (Last NFT) = 7,390 $ETH. This Strategy allows the 50% Royalties to sustain. This would also fund cash flow to OurGalaxy.DAO Treasury for future development. The first usage of the fund would be the Mint-to-Earn explained below.</p>
									<p><section class="image fit"><div class="image"><img src="images/price.png" alt="" /></div></p></section>
									<hr />
								<h3>Last Minter Reward</h3>
									<p>What is the <i>incentive</i> for the <strong>last Galaxian Pioneer</strong>?</p> An ~2x immediate ROIðŸ’¥ of 7.4 $ETH would be given to the Last Minter.
									<p>Without the Last Galaxian Pioneer, OurGalaxy Phase 1 would not be seen by anyone. The Treasury would contribute 0.1% of the Total Sales Revenue to the Last Minter.</p>
									<p>Still confused with the mathematics?? No worries, <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/155JXI-csYr96IThR77pRhFHlfrrN4glrpvBF_ugq-4E/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">an interactive spreadsheet</a> is prepared for you to understand our Tokenomics:)</p>

									<h2>OurGalaxyDAO</h2>
									<p>Why are we "Revolutionizing" NFT minting?</p>
								</header>
								<p>We Believe Minting Means We Are Kick Starting A Civilization. A Civilization means we are together painting a vision. </p>
								<p>OurGalaxy Phase 1 is a Galaxy Puzzle formed by 79,363,224 Pixels, symbolizing 1% pioneer of our World's Population. These Pixels are grouped into 62x62 = 3,844 puzzles, held by each Galaxian Pioneer's hand. Before anyone mint the last puzzle, no one sees OurGalaxy Phase 1.</p>
								<h2>Mint-to-Earn</h2>
								<p>Mint-to-Earn is a mechanish to pay rewards with voting in <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/ourgalaxy.eth/about" target="_blank">Snapshot</a> to Galaxian NFT with special traits. Each Galaxian NFT = 1 vote in Snapshot. Join <a href="https://discord.gg/QsHEJ9bPrt" target="_blank">OurGalaxy Discord</a> to learn more.
								<p>When Phase 1 is complete, we would explore a Metaverse for anyone to exhibit OurGALAXY Phase 1. (I bet everyone would be AMAZED by the Puzzle end product!!) Decisions are made by votings in DAO.</p>
								</section>
								<hr />
								<h2>Phase 2 Play-to-Earn Pixel (Puzzle)</h2>
								<p>After the vote of OurGalaxy Phase 2 Storyline, the Puzzle for Phase 2 start to be minted by the community. The initial idea is to only give the y-coordinate for each puzzle, randomly minted. Our community has to solve each row for the puzzle as Play-to-Earn explained below.</p>
								<p>Once the Pixels are minted, they will be available in Opensea.io for anyone to PLAY.</p>Whoever finishes solving 1 row gains Rewards from 1% of OurGalaxy.DAO Treasury. The Rewards would be dynamic but estimated to be >5.5 $ETH in our <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/155JXI-csYr96IThR77pRhFHlfrrN4glrpvBF_ugq-4E/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Tokenomics Calculations</a>.</p>
								<p><section class="image fit"><div class="image"><img src="images/solve.png" alt="" /></div></p></section>
								<p>The rewards is first-come-first-served. This creates a dynamic price model.</p>
								<p>When more pixels are minted, the Treasury has a higher funding = higher rewards. Also means that if someone solved the row earlier, he/she might receive less rewards than solving later. BUT you are also competing with everyone in the world. So, it is also a Game Theory HAHA</p>
								<h3>NFT Owners (Galaxians) vote for the rewards release and the GALAXY</h3>
								<p>How to partipate the Play-to-Earn puzzle? Anyone could participate. But only the Galaxian Pioneers have the <b>Voting Rights</b> on the submissions and rewards release in Snapshot. The whole project aims at being community-driven.</p>
								
								<hr />
								<h5>What Is Game Theory?</h5>
								<blockquote>Game theory is a theoretical framework for conceiving social situations among competing players. In some respects, game theory is the science of strategy, or at least the optimal decision-making of independent and competing actors in a strategic setting. - Investopedia</blockquote>
								<hr />
								<h2>Founder's Rewards</h2>
								<p>The Founder <i>COULD NOT</i> purchase any GALAXIAN with the Treasury Funds. I chose to be funded back from the 20% Initial Sales Smart Contract to cover all the costs, e.g. Gas Fees, ENS Domain, Arweave Storage... This could further prevent the centralization of votes in my hand as well.</p>

				But then no matter how much effort I had spent on the Roadmap earlier. <br />
				<br />I feel far more excited looking forward to seeing the democractic future of OurGalaxy now.</section></p>
